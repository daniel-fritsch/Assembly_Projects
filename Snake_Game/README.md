# Snake Game

This is an implementation of the common game snake in MIPS assembly. The player has to pilot a 
snake around a grid safely avoiding the walls and itself as obstacles. On its way the objective 
is to collect apples generated randomly across the board until the player reaches a total of 
20 apples at which point they win the game!

Should the player run into themself or into the wall of the grid an error message is printed on
the screen and the game is lost.
