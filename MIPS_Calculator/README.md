**MIPS 4-Function Calculator

Basic 4 function calculator in MIPS assembly.

This is a basic program in MIPS assembly designed to emulate a simple 4-function calculator.

The user is given the option to provide any of the following symbols: +,-,*,/,=,c, or q.

Following the user input this allows the user to then perform that specific operation upon the current value. For the letters c and q(clear and quit respectively) the user either clear the current value and sets it to 0 or quits the program entirely.

In the case of an operator input that operation is performed on a number which the program asks for follwing the user input. Following the induction of this number the operation is performed on the current value with that new user-provided value.

The program will continue to run via a loop until q is designated by the user to order a quit operation.

The calculator cannot process float numbers. Values provided by the user should be given as integers.
